 <h2>Shauna Smith</h2>
 <p>My name is Shauna Smith. I'm 20 years old. I attended The Queen's School. I am currently a second year Computer Science major at the University Of the West Indies, Mona. I am interested in the course Web Development 
    because I want to be a Front-End Web Developer. In high school for my Information Technology IA, I was required to create a website. I liked creating the website and it interested me to pursue a career in it.</p>
